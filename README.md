# Hello, everyone :wave:!

Hey, my name is Jomar Rumbawa â€” web developer based out of Seattle, Washington. I've always found coding a way to exercise my brain and continue to push my limits on how I think. Being able to continuously solve different problems is what makes me excited about being a developer. I mainly code in JavaScript, but I'm very adaptable on learning new technologies when necessary.

I love learning new things and working in collaborative environments. Being self-driven, as well as a team player, I believe I can give a company immediate value upon joining.

## My Tools & Tech :rocket:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/
